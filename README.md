# ASCII Console 3D Graphics Engine
This console-based 3D graphics engine uses ASCII characters to display 3D objects within the terminal.
It supports loading wavefront .obj files, allowing for rendering mesh objects with adjustable positions, scales, and rotations.
Developed in C++, it relies on windows.h to get the keyboard input to move around the camera.
